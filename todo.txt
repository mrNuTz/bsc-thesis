DONE:
  get latex to run
  how did i modify ssdeep?
FIRST:
  Q: wallet types: how where the types assigned? what do they mean? does same type mean same sol code?
TODO:
  use what you already have starting with the most important
    integrate important stuff from notes repo
    reference framework and test-set repos
    add minimum amount to finish
    interpret clustering and scatters
      check robustness against version, abi encoding and optimization changes separately
  how do the modified ssdeep results compare?
LATER:
  reference ppdeep: ssdeep like hashing method in pure python https://github.com/elceef/ppdeep
  reference the commit id when generating images
  reference to paper on spamsum, differences to ssdeep
  small overview of similarity measures
    explanation: what are they use for
    differences
    suitability: their results, why did I not use it, my results
  argue why JUMPI is sufficient
    maybe try more control-flow-ops as splitter
    argue why this block splitting is bad (optimization changes this)
      JUMP 0x56, RETURN 0xF3, STOP 0x00, REVERT 0xFD
      followed by JUMPDEST 0x5B
      (\x56|\xF3|\x00|\xFD)\\x5B#
MAYBE:
  section on time and space complexity
    wicherski2009pehash -> 1.1 Related Work
  test sdHash
  read about MRS hashing
    is in O(n)
  read about bbr
  mention Instruction n-grams
    filter some push pop instructions and leaf in less common instructions
FINALLY:
  use bibtex refs with web-links

  install the following packages in tex-live
    latexmk
    ly1
    csquotes
    biber
