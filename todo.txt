DONE:
  get latex to run
  how did i modify ssdeep?
  reference to paper on spamsum, differences to ssdeep
  reference ppdeep: ssdeep like hashing method in pure python https://github.com/elceef/ppdeep
  reference framework and test-set repos
FIRST:
  Q: wallet types: how where the types assigned? what do they mean? does same type mean same sol code?
TODO:
  use what you already have starting with the most important
    integrate important stuff from notes repo
    add minimum amount to finish
    interpret clustering and scatters
      check robustness against version, abi encoding and optimization changes separately
  how do the modified ssdeep results compare?
  don't forget that f-stat on solc-testset is cheating
LATER:
  reference the commit id when generating images
  small overview of similarity measures
    explanation: what are they use for
    differences
    suitability: their results, why did I not use it, my results
  argue why JUMPI is sufficient
    maybe try more control-flow-ops as splitter
    argue why this block splitting is bad (optimization changes this)
      JUMP 0x56, RETURN 0xF3, STOP 0x00, REVERT 0xFD
      followed by JUMPDEST 0x5B
      (\x56|\xF3|\x00|\xFD)\\x5B#
MAYBE:
  section on time and space complexity
    wicherski2009pehash -> 1.1 Related Work
  test sdHash
  read about MRS hashing
    is in O(n)
  read about bbr
  mention Instruction n-grams
    filter some push pop instructions and leaf in less common instructions
FINALLY:
  use bibtex refs with web-links
NOTES:
  delete tmp files: git clean -xf
