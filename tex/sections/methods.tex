To obtain similarity scores I preprocessed the codes calculated digests(hashes) and compared those digest via similarity measures. Following is a quick summary of the methods used in this work.

\subsection{Digest Methods}
The following methods where used to obtain digests from codes for quick comparison via the similarity measures.

\begin{description}[style=unboxed,leftmargin=0cm]%style=nextline]
  \item[Fourbytes]
    Extraction of the set of fourbyte signatures used to identify the interface functions.

  \item[Bytebag]
    Counting all opcodes in the code to form a multiset or bag of byte-values, a bytebag.

  \item[Size]
    Just the length of the code in bytes.

  \item[ssdeep]
    A Context Triggered Piecewise Hashing (CTPH) Function.

  \item[ppdeep Levenshtein]
    Slightly different implementation of ssdeep in pure python.

  \item[ppdeep\_mod Levenshtein]
    Modified version of ppdeep.

  \item[Lempel-Ziv Jaccard Distance]
    Generates a compression dictionary.

  \item[JUMP-Hash Levenshtein]
    A piecewise hash splitting by the \code{JUMPI} instruction opcode \code{0x57}.

  \item[BZ-Hash Levenshtein]
    Also splits by \code{JUMPI} and calculate a compression-ratio for each piece.
\end{description}

\subsection{Similarity Measures}
To compare the digests the following similarity measures where applied.

\begin{description}[style=unboxed]
  \item[Jaccard Index] Defined on two sets \(A, B\), the Jaccard Index \(J\) is the ratio of common entries to all entries.  \(J(A,B) = |A \cap B| / |A \cup B| \in [0,1]\)
  \item[Levenshtein similarity] Based on the Levenshtein Distance.
  \item[Normalized Compression Distance (NCD)]
    NCD is a measure for how well two files co-compress. The more features two files have in common the shorter the result when compressing the concatenation of the two files.
\end{description}

\subsection{Pre-Processing Methods}
Because small changes in the codes, can cause big changes in the digests pre-processing aims the remove non-essential parts.

\begin{description}[style=unboxed]
  \item[Segment Selection] Selecting e.g. only the first code segment, the actual contract.
  \item[Skeletonization] Setting argument, data and meta section bytes to zero.
  \item[Opcode filteringn] Filtering for more significant opcodes by setting the others to zero or cutting them out.
\end{description}
