To compare the similarity measures and evaluate there efficacy a package including test-sets,
similarity-measures, python utils for exploration and evaluate was created. For reuse it is available publicly \cite{ethereum-contract-similarity}.

To quickly evaluate how well the methods distinguish between code-pairs with both codes from the same group and pairs of codes from different groups the "separation" was calculated.
It specifies the following ratio.
When the pairs are ordered by similarity-score, how many same-group pairs are in the upper window of size total the number of same-group pairs.
