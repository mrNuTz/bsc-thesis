To compare the similarity measures and evaluate there efficacy a package including test-sets,
similarity-measures, python utils for exploration and evaluate was created (ethereum-contract-similarity \cite{ethereum-contract-similarity}).

To quickly evaluate how well the methods distinguish between code-pairs with both codes from the same group and pairs of codes from different groups the \code{separation} was defined.
It specifies the following ratio.
When the pairs are ordered by similarity-score, how many same-group pairs are in the upper window of size total number of same-group pairs.
