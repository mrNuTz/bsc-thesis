\headline{Next Steps}
Studying code pairs where different methods yield disagreeing scores.

Clustering codes known to be similar to see if further subdivision is meaningful.

Combinational similarity scores starting with fast methods like \n{fourbyte} and \n{bytebag}.

Extend \n{\solcts} by renaming functions, this results in changed \n{fourbyte} signatures, in turn leading to a reordering of the code, due to \n{solc} ordering functions by signature.
