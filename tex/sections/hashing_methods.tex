\subsection{Signature similarity}

The macro-similarity based on the contract-interface is described in `II.C.2) Interface Restoration`\aycite{di2020characteristics}

\subsection{ssdeep - Context Triggered Piecewise Hashes (CTPH)}
ssdeep is based on spamsum\cite{spamsum} wich was written for email spam detection.

Context Triggered Piecewise Hashes follow the steps:
\begin{ol}
  \item Compute a rolling hash of the last n bytes for every position.
  \item The rolling hash is used to determine the cutoff points.
  \item The resulting chunks are hashed using a traditional cryptographic hash.
  \item The final hash results from concatenating part of the chunk-hashes (e.g. the last byte).
\end{ol}

\subsubsection{Modified ssdeep}
The following modifications where made:
\begin{ul}
  \item Remove sequence-stripping. It made many hashes incomparable because of long strips of 'K' chunk-hashes.
  \item Remove rounding in the score calculation to differentiate between exact match and close match as well as incomparable and minor similarity.
  \item Remove common substring detection to make more hashes comparable.
  \item Handle case where first chunk is never triggered.
  \item Add option to use Jaccard-Index for comparison.
\end{ul}

\subsubsection{JUMP-Hash}

\subsection{Bytebag - Op-Code Frequency}
As lower reference bound for more complex similarity detection I implemented the following measure:

\begin{ol}
  \item Count every byte-value in the code forming a multiset or bag of byte-values, a bytebag.
  \item Compare via Jaccard-Index for bags.
\end{ol}

\subsection{LZJD - Binary-Hashing}
This is how a cite\cite{sung2004static} looks like.
