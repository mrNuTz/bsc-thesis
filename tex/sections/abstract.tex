Because of the high number of smart contracts deployed every hour, fast classification is needed for the analysis of blockchain activity.
Fuzzy hashing (similarity preserving hashing) is a popular tool when dealing with large amounts of data.
In this work we explore the landscape of binary similarity hashing and evaluate such methods for use on Ethereum smart contracts.
To aid the process a evaluation framework in Python was implemented and sets of pre-classified contracts where defined.
