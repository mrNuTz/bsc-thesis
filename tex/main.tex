\section{Introduction}

Fast clustering of EVM-Bytecodes by similar functionality, via similarity hashing.
Specifically, adapt \code{ssdeep} and compare to other similarity hashing methods,
and then evaluate the clustering based on human matched codes.
To accomplish this task I worte a set of reusable python utilities.
